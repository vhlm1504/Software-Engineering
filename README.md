## English Introduction

- I created this repository while I was in college, mainly to save my notes and personal studies on software engineering as a backup.
- Over time, many people started to give stars and fork this repository, especially Brazilians who are starting their studies in the area.
- This repository also motivated me to create [my personal website](https://alexgalhardo.com) at the end of 2023, to do something more organized and to reach more people, mainly to improve my English studies as well, in addition to serving as a portfolio and sharing side projects that I have been doing in my free time for educational purposes.
- In July 2024, I did a major refactoring of this repository with more information, content and better organization of the files.
- I wish I had a reference like this with hundreds of other useful study references when I started studying programming and technology back in 2016.
- I really enjoy sharing knowledge and making these study notes, whether for personal or professional purposes, I hope they are useful for you too.

## PT-BR Introdução
- Eu criei esse repositório enquanto estava na universidade, principalmente para salvar como backup, minhas anotações e estudos pessoais sobre engenharia de software.
- Com o passar do tempo, muitas pessoas começaram a dar estrelinhas e fazer o fork desse repositório, principalmente brasileiros que estão começando os estudos na área. 
- Esse repositório também me motivou a criar [meu site pessoal](https://alexgalhardo.com) no final de 2023, para fazer algo mais organizado e para alcançar mais pessoas, principalmente para melhorar meus estudos em inglês também, além de servir como portfólio e compartilhar projetos paralelos que venho fazendo no meu tempo livre para fins didáticos.
- Em julho de 2024 fiz uma grande refatoração nesse repositório com mais informação, conteúdo e melhor organização dos arquivos.
- Eu gostaria de ter tido uma referência assim com centenas de outras referências úteis de estudo quando comecei a estudar programação e tecnologia la em 2016.
- Uma boa parte desse repositório esta em português, e o restante em inglês. Dizer que aprender inglês em pleno século XXI é extremamente importante e essencial é clichê né.
- Eu gosto bastante de compartilhar conhecimento e fazer essas anotações de estudos, seja para fins pessoais e profissionais, espero que elas sejam úteis para vocês também.

## The 4 Steps to Competence

- 1 - Unconsciously incompetent: “you don’t know how much you don’t know”
- 2 - Consciously incompetent: “you know how much you don’t know”
- 3 - Consciously competent: “you already know how much you know”
- 4 - Wisdom: “unconsciously you don’t know how much you know”

## The 4 Ways to Spend Money - Milton Friedman

According to economist Milton Friedman, there are 4 ways to spend money:

1. Spend my money on me:
   - In this case, I have the incentive to look for the best value for money
   - Good service at a fair price
2. Spending my money on other people:
   - In this type of situation, the objective is to save money, the price is more important than the quality of the service
   - An average service for a good price
3. Spending someone else’s money on me:
   - In this case, money is spent with great attention to quality, but with little interest in seeking the best price
   - Excellent service at a high price
4. Spending someone else’s money on a third party:
   - In a situation like this, there is little incentive to care about both service quality and price
   - Bad service for a high price or good service for an extremely high price

## Principles

- “Bad software that adds value > Perfect software that adds no value.”
- “Learn to say: I DON’T Know, and if necessary, try to learn.”
- “Premature optimization: the root of all evil.”
- “Remember that dinosaurs are almost always the best references.”
- “He who thinks little makes a lot of mistakes” - Leonardo da Vinci
- "In God I trust. Everyone else must bring data.”
- “Lack of money is the root of all evil.”
- “There is no silver bullet.”
- “Make it work > Do it correctly.”
- “Increase revenue > reduce costs.”
- “SaaS > PaaS > IaaS > In-House”
- “You != Unicorn”
- “Always try to understand what is happening under the hood.”
- “Write code != program != software engineering”
- “Maintenance > Performance”
- “No metrics, no optimization”
- “Never stop questioning”
- “Software engineering is 80% THINKING about the problem, and 20% HOW to solve the problem.”
- “The more knowledge you have, the less you know. EGO = 1 / knowledge.”
- “Everyone should care about quality”
- “At least 80% of the code of good software has been redone, shortened or better yet, deleted. Less is more."
- “2+2 is not 5, no matter how many people say that.”
- “Principles > Analogy.”
- “Talk and learn from people smarter than you.”
- “Always try to use the single source of truth.”
- “Don’t reinvent the wheel. That’s what ready-made frameworks and libraries exist for.”
- “It’s always good to study a tool in depth before putting it into production.”
- “Modularization is everything.”
- “Good artists copy, great artists steal.”
- “Innovation only exists in a world of restriction, not abundance.”
- “There will always be something to improve. Done is better than perfect.”
